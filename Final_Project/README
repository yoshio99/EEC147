The final project was designed to test implementations of architectures other than FCs and CNNs with the goal being a classification task of EEG data. My project implemented
and optimized Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and a CNN-RNN hybrid. Different architectures were designed for each model type, and after
hyperparameter tuning, were tested via cross validation. It was found that a CNN-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory RNN) hybrid worked best in exploiting the temporality of the EEG data 
and performed best on the test set. It was also found that data augmentation in the form of subsampling helped to vastly improve the accuracy of all models.
